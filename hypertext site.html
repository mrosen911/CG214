       <p id="p1">Blogging has become such a big trend and is now the new modern, self-help book, for millennials. Celebrities and people all over the world want a blog to share their thoughts and opinions on everything from food to fashion, politics and everything in between. I wanted to make my original a website a blog sort of making fun of other blogs, how original, and since that is the vision I have for our homework/class site, I do not want to do the same thing. I think a hypertext seems interesting. I do not know very much about hypertexts and think that it would be an interesting thing to learn about. Hypertexts could become the newest trend and will help everyone learn a new trade.</p>

        <p id="p2">Hypertexts, according to the website attached on GitHub, are a nonlinear form of digital text that allows a user to choose their own pathway among multiple interconnected elements. Based on this description and the pictures that were displayed on the screen, this sounds like an interesting midterm project. I would like to do a hypertext/blog about my life. I was thinking about how my life story is bound to be interesting to someone, so I might as well make a blog about it but with a little spunk in the form of a hypertext. I would like to start the hypertext on the home screen with a map of Houston, Texas, which is where I am from. It is going to have places to click on such as my home, my middle and high school, and the place where I spent most of my summers and free time.</p>
