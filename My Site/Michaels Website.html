        <p> Overall I think this class has been a success. There are times when the class is more humid than outside, and <b> Mama June</b> and I are one in the same.<br> <img src= "images/giphy.gif"/ width="200 height" height= "150"> 
        
            <p> Although she doesn't know how to code, she does know how to raise kids properly. Even though we are not children Shaun, the greatest professor ever, may feel like he has to treat us like kids. No one said teaching was easy, just like coding isn't easy.

        <div> I am not sure what I am going to get out of this class, but whatever I do manage to soak up in this sponge of a brain will be more than I knew before. I only hope to make a successful coder and be the next Mark Zuckerberg. If none of Y'all have seen <i> The Social Network </i> I highly recommend watching it. Jesse Eisenberg recieved an Oscar nomination for portraying the Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg. Who knows maybe one day there will be an Oscar win, let alone a nomiation for the role of Shaun Axani! :) <br> <img src="images/socialnetwork.jpg" width="120" height="150"/> </div>
        
        <br> The video shown below was taken on July 4th. I was able to watch the Macy's firework show in NYC, since I was here for the summer. The fireworks were being launched 3 blocks from my apartment, hence the miraculous video. PSA: Please ignore the video due to the fact that my voice is horrendous on camera.

I recommend you checking out the restaurant and letting me know if it is good, as well as watching the fireworks from there.
