        <p id="paragraph2"><img src="images/kardash.gif" width="250" height="134">Throughout this blog/website/coding experience on the screen, you will learn how to upscale your life and style into those in the magazines. P.S.A - I am not a bougee person, I just aspire to be, but I will teach you what I know! Remember, the Kardashians used to wear the fugliest clothes and now look at them, all it takes is time and some rich prick to treat you like royalty- </p>
                
    <p id="paragraph3"> I am not saying this is going to be the best blog ever being that I have created new information every week, however it is a work in progress and will be excellent in no time! Thank you for being patient with me as I am going through this construction. I don't quite know if any of this is making sense, but just like an hermes Birkin is rare and takes time to create, so does my website. </p>

        <p> The video shown below was taken on July 4th. I was able to watch the Macy's firework show in NYC, since I was here for the summer. The fireworks were being launched 3 blocks from my apartment, hence the miraculous video. PSA: Please ignore the video due to the fact that my voice is horrendous on camera.</p>

I recommend you checking out the restaurant and letting me know if it is good, as well as watching the fireworks from there.
