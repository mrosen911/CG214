The <b>JCC</b>, Jewish Community Center, is equivelant to the YMCA for Jews. Almost every major city has at least one, sometimes more. They provide programs for children, teens, adults, and senior citizens. From musical theatre to water aerobics and everything in between, the JCC is a welcome center to all. I was lucky enough to go to summer camp at the JCC, and after school programs as well. Also, I was a counselor for kids going into Kindergarten for five years. I created so many memories there as a kid and throughout my adolescent years.</p> <br>
