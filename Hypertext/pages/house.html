        I lived in Houston, Texas for the first 18 years of my life. I still consider it home and plan on moving back in the near future. There is something about the place you grew up that stays with you forever. I never moved houses, I was at the same address for my entire life. Actually, my parents are wanting to move and have started to pack the house, so this is quite sad. I loved my house, it wasn't the biggest or the fanciest, but it was home. <br><br><b></b></p>

        <li>I bust my lip open when I was three on the bunk beds in my room</li>
        <li>I broke my arm in the living room standing on a metal trashcan</li>
        <li>I threw a candle stick at the window and shattered the glass</li>
        <li>My brother and I fought in every room</li>
        <li>I crawled through the dog door hundreds of times</li>
        <li>I cleaned up dog pee in all of the rooms</li>
        <li>A stray cat once ran into our house, and a bee infestation </li>
