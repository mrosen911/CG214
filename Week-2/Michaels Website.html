        <p> Overall I think this class has been a success. There are times when the class is more humid than outside, and <b> Mama June</b> and I are one in the same.<img src= 'giphy.gif'> 
        
            <p> Although she doesn't know how to code, she does know how to raise kids properly. Even though we are not children Shaun, the greatest professor ever, may feel like he has to treat us like kids. No one said teaching was easy, just like coding isn't easy.

        <div> I am not sure what I am going to get out of this class, but whatever I do manage to soak up in this sponge of a brain will be more than I knew before. I only hope to make a successful coder and be the next Mark Zuckerberg <P> <img src="the%20social%20network.gif"/ width="300" height="180"/> </P>
        If none of Y'all have seen <i> The Social Network </i> I highly recommend watching it. Jesse Eisenberg recieved an Oscar nomination for portraying the Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg. Who knows maybe one day there will be an Oscar win, let alone a nomiation for the role of Shaun Axani! :) <img src="socialnetwork.jpg" width="300" height="400"/> </div>
        
        Check out my post next week! Thanks for being great fans, I look forward to rocking Y'alls world again and again. Just rememeber life is a party, so always be VIP.
